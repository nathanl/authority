module Authority

  # Should be included into all models in a Rails app. Provides the model
  # with both class and instance methods like `updatable_by?(user)`
  # Exactly which methods get defined is determined from `config.abilities`;
  # the module is evaluated after any user-supplied config block is run
  # in order to make that possible.
  # All delegate to the methods of the same name on the model's authorizer.
