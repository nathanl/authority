# Authority

Authority gives you a clean and easy way to say, in your Rails app, **who** is allowed to do **what** with your models. Unauthorized actions get a warning and an entry in a log file.

It requires that you already have some kind of user object in your application, accessible from all controllers (like `current_user`).

## TL;DR

No time for reading! Reading is for chumps! Here's the skinny:

- Install in your Rails project: add to Gemfile, `bundle`, then `rails g authority:install`
- For each model you have, create a corresponding [authorizer](#authorizers). For example, for `app/models/lolcat.rb`, create `app/authorizers/lolcat_authorizer.rb` with an empty `class LolcatAuthorizer < Authority::Authorizer`.
  - Add class methods to that authorizer to set rules that can be enforced just by looking at the resource class, like "this user cannot create Lolcats, period."
  - Add instance methods to that authorizer to set rules that need to look at a resource instance, like "a user can only edit a Lolcat if it belongs to that user and has not been marked as 'classic'".
- Wire up your user, models and controllers to work with your authorizers:
  - In your [user class](#users), `include Authority::UserAbilities`.
  - Put this in your [controllers](#controllers): `authorize_actions_for YourModelNameHere` (the model that controller works with)
  - Put this in your [models](#models):  `include Authority::Abilities`

## Overview

Still here? Reading is fun! You always knew that. Time for a deeper look at things.

The goals of Authority are:

- To allow broad, class-level rules. Examples: 
  - "Basic users cannot delete any Widget."
  - "Only admin users can create Offices."
- To allow fine-grained, instance-level rules. Examples: 
  - "Management users can only edit schedules with date ranges in the future."
  - "Users can't create playlists more than 20 songs long unless they've paid."
- To provide a clear syntax for permissions-based views. Example:
  - `link_to 'Edit Widget', edit_widget_path(@widget) if current_user.can_update?(@widget)`
- To gracefully handle any access violations: display a "you can't do that" screen and log the violation.
- To do all of this **without cluttering** either your controllers or your models. This is done by letting Authorizer classes do most of the work. More on that below.

## The flow of Authority

In broad terms, the authorization process flows like this:

- A user object is asked whether it can do some action to a resource class or instance, like `current_user.can_create?(Widget)` or `current_user.can_update?(@widget)`.
- The user just asks the model the same question: `resource.creatable_by?(self)`.
- The model passes that question to its Authorizer, which actually contains the logic to answer the question.
- The Authorizer returns an answer back up the call chain to the original caller.

## Installation

First, check in whatever changes you've made to your app already. You want to see what we're doing to your app, don't you?

Now, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'authority'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install authority

Then run the generator:

    $ rails g authority:install

Hooray! New files! Go look at them. Look look look.

## Usage

<a name="users">
### Users

Your user model (whatever you call it) should `include Authority::UserAbilities`. This defines methods like `can_update?(resource)`. These methods do nothing but pass the question on to the resource itself. For example, `resource.updatable_by?(user)`.

The list of methods that get defined comes from `config.abilities`.

<a name="models">
### Models

In your models, `include Authority::Abilities`. This sets up both class-level and instance-level methods like `creatable_by?(user)`, etc. 

The list of methods that get defined comes from `config.abilities`.

You **could** define those methods yourself on the model, but to keep things organized, we want to put all our authorization logic in authorizer classes. Therefore, these methods, too, are pass-through, which delegate to corresponding methods on the model's authorizer. For example, the `Rabbit` model's `editable_by?(user)` would delegate to `RabbitAuthorizer.editable_by?(user)`.

Which leads us to...

<a name="authorizers">
### Authorizers

Authorizers should be added under `app/authorizers`, one for each of your models. So if you have a `LaserCannon` model, you should have, at minimum:

    # app/authorizers/laser_cannon_authorizer.rb
    class LaserCannonAuthorizer < Authority::Authorizer
      # Nothing defined - just use the default strategy
    end

These are where your actual authorization logic goes. Here's how you do it:

- Class methods answer questions about model classes, like "is it **ever** permissible for this user to update a widget?"
  - Any class method you don't define (for example, if you didn't make a `def self.updatable_by?(user)`) will fall back to your [configurable default strategy](#default_strategies).
- Instance methods answer questions about model instances, like "can this user update this **particular** widget?" (Within an instance method, you can get the model instance with `resource`).
  - Any instance method you don't define (for example, if you didn't make a `def deletable_by?(user)`) will fall back to the corresponding class method. In other words, if you haven't said whether a user can update **this particular** widget, we'll decide by checking whether they can update **any** widget.

So, suppose you've got the empty `LaserCannonAuthorizer` above and haven't supplied a default strategy. Then you ask the authorizer "is `@laser_cannon_x.deletable_by?(@user_y)`?" It will ask itself:

- "Do I have a `deletable_by?` method, to tell me whether this particular laser cannon can be deleted by this user? ... No."
- "OK, do I have a `self.deletable_by?` method, to tell me whether **any** laser cannon can be deleted by this user? ... No."
- "OK, did the user define a default strategy for deciding whether any resource can be deleted by a user? ... No."
- "Well, I do have a **default** default strategy, which always returns false. So the answer is 'false' - the user can't delete this laser cannon."

As you can see, **you can specify different logic for every method on every model, or [supply a single default strategy](#default_strategies) that covers them all, or anything in between**.

And because the **default** default strategy returns false, we start by assuming that **everything is forbidden**. This whitelisting approach will keep you from accidentally allowing things you didn't intend. 

#### An Authorizer Tutorial

Let's work our way up from the simplest possible authorizer to see how you can customize your rules.

If your authorizer looks like this:

    # app/authorizers/laser_cannon_authorizer.rb
    class LaserCannonAuthorizer < Authority::Authorizer
    end

... you will find that everything is forbidden:

    current_user.can_create?(LaserCannon)    # false; you haven't defined a class-level `can_create?`, so the 
                                             # `default_strategy` is used. It returns false.
    current_user.can_create?(@laser_cannon)  # false; instance-level permissions check class-level ones by default,
                                             # so this is the same as the previous example.

If you update your authorizer as follows:

    # app/authorizers/laser_cannon_authorizer.rb
    class LaserCannonAuthorizer < Authority::Authorizer

      # Class-level permissions
      #
      def self.creatable_by?(user)
        true # blanket true means that **any** user can create a laser cannon
      end

      def self.deletable_by?(user)
        false # blanket false means that **no** user can delete a laser cannon
      end

      # Instance-level permissions
      #
      def updatable_by?(user)
        resource.color == 'blue' && user.first_name == 'Larry' && Date.today.friday?
      end

    end

... you can now do the following:

    current_user.can_create?(LaserCannon)    # true, per class method above
    current_user.can_create?(@laser_cannon)  # true; inherited instance method calls class method
    current_user.can_delete?(@laser_cannon)  # false
    current_user.can_update?(@laser_cannon)  # Only Larry, only blue laser cannons, and only on 
                                             # Fridays (weapons maintenance day)
<a name="default_strategies">
#### Default Strategies

To take a different approach, if you wanted to answer all these questions in a uniform way - perhaps by looking up permissions in a database table - you could just supply a default strategy that does that.

    # In config/initializers/authority.rb
    config.default_strategy = Proc.new { |able, authorizer, user|
     # Does the user have any of the roles which give this permission?
     (roles_which_grant(able, authorizer) & user.roles).any?
    }

That's it! All your authorizer classes could be left empty.

<a name="controllers">
### Controllers

#### Basic Usage

In your controllers, add this method call:

    authorize_actions_for ModelName

That sets up a `before_filter` that **calls your class-level methods before each action**. For instance, before running the `update` action, it will check whether the current user (determined using the configurable `user_method`) `can_update?(ModelName)` at a class level. A return value of false means "this user can never update models of this class."

By the way, any options you pass in will be used on the `before_filter` that gets created, so you can do things like this:

    authorize_actions_for InvisibleSwordsman, :only => :show

#### Usage within a controller action

If you need to check some attributes of a model instance to decide if an action is permissible, you can use the **singular** `authorize_action_for(@resource_instance)`. This method will determine which controller action it was called from, look at the controller action map, determine which method should be checked on the model, and check it.

The default controller action map is as follows:

    {
      :index   => 'read',   # index action requires that the user can_read?(resource)
      :show    => 'read',   # etc
      :new     => 'create',
      :create  => 'create',
      :edit    => 'update',
      :update  => 'update',
      :destroy => 'delete'
    }

So, for example, if you did this:

    class MessageController < ApplicationController
    ...

      def edit
        @message = Message.find(params[:id])
        authorize_action_for(@message)
      end
      ...

    end

... Authority would determine that it was called from within `edit`, that the `edit` controller action requires permission to `update`, and check whether the current user `can_update?(@message)`.

Each controller gets its own copy of the controller action map. If you want to edit a **single** controller's action map, you can either pass a hash into `authorize_actions_for`, which will get merged into the existing actions hash...

    class BadgerController < ApplicationController
      authorize_actions_for Badger, :actions => {:neuter => 'update'}
      ...
    end

...or you can use a separate method call:

    class BadgerController < ApplicationController
      authorize_actions_for Badger

      authority_action :neuter => 'update'

      ...
    end

Finally, if you want to update this hash for **all** your controllers, you can do that with `config.controller_action_map` in the initializer.

## Views

Assuming your user object is available in your views, you can do all kinds of conditional rendering. For example:

    `link_to 'Edit Widget', edit_widget_path(@widget) if current_user.can_update?(@widget)`

If the user isn't allowed to edit widgets, they won't see the link. If they're nosy and try to hit the URL directly, they'll get a... **SECURITY VIOLATION** (cue cheesy, dramatic music).

## Security Violations

Anytime a user attempts an unauthorized action, Authority does two things:

- Renders your `public/403.html`
- Logs the violation to whatever logger you configured.

If you want to set up a `cron` job to watch the log file, look up the user's name and address, and dispatch minions to fill their mailbox with goose droppings, that's really up to you. I got nothing to do with it, man.

## Configuration

Configuration should be done from `config/initializers/authority.rb`, which will be generated for you by `rails g authority:install`. That file includes copious documentation. Copious, do you hear me?!

Ahem. Note that the configuration block in that file **must** run in your application. Authority metaprograms its methods on boot, but waits until your configuration block has run to do so. If you want the default settings, you don't have to put anything in your configure block, but you must at least run `Authority.configure`.

Some of the things you can configure which haven't already been mentioned are...

### Abilities

If you want to be able to say `user.can_eat?` and have Authority ask the model and authorizer if the resource is `edible_by?` the user, edit your `config.abilities` to include `{:eat => 'edible'}`.

### Logging

Authority will log a message any time a user tries to access a resource for which they are not authorized. By default, this is logged to standard error, but you can supply whatever logger you want, as long as it responds to `warn`. Some possible settings are:

    config.logger = Rails.logger
    config.logger = Logger.new('logs/authority.log') # From Ruby standard library

## Custom authorizer inheritence

If you want to customize your authorizers even further - for example, maybe you want them all to have a method like `has_permission?(user, permission_name)` - you can insert a custom class into the inheritance chain.

    # lib/my_app/authorizer.rb
    module MyApp
      class Authorizer < Authority::Authorizer
      
        def self.has_permission(user, permission_name)
          # look that up somewhere
        end

      end
    end
  
    #app/authorizers/badger_authorizer.rb
    class BadgerAuthorizer < MyApp::Authorizer
      # contents
    end

If you decide to place your custom class in `lib` as shown above (as opposed to putting it in `app`), you should require it at the bottom of `config/initializers/authority.rb`.

## Integration Notes

- If you want to have nice log messages for security violations, you should ensure that your user object has a `to_s` method; this will control how it shows up in log messages saying things like "**Kenneth Lay** is not allowed to delete this resource:..."
